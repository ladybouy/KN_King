### Exercise 7.13
Assume that a program contain the following declarations:

```
char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5
```
Give the value and the type of each expression listed below.
```
(a) c * i       int, -3
(b) s + m       long, 7 
(c) f / c       float, 0.65f
(d) d / s       double, 3.75
(e) f - d       double, -1.0 
(f) (int) f     int, 6
```
