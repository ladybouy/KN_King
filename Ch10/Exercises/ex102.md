### EXERCISE 10.2
The following program outline shows only function definitions and variable declarations.

```
int b, c

void f(void)
{
    int b, d;
}

void g(int a)
{
    int c;
    {
        int a, d;
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    int c, d;
}
```

For each of the following scopes, list a variables and parameter names visible in that scope.
If there's more than one variable or parameter with the same name, indicate which one is visible.

```
(a) The f function
(b) The g function
(c) The block in which a and d are declared
(d) The main function
```

Solution:

```
(a) b (from in block), c, d
(b) a (from in bracket block), c (from function block), d
(c) a (from bracket block), b, c (from function block), d (from bracket block)  
(d) b, c (from main block), d; 
```
