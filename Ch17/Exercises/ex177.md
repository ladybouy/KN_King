## EXERCISE 17.7
The following loop is supposed to delete all nodes from a linked list and release the memory that they occupy. Unfortunately, the loop is incorrect. Explain what's wrong with it and show how to fix the bug.
```c
for (p = first; p != NULL; p = p->next)
    free(p);
```
### Solution
The memory p points to, is released, but the loop attempts to access p for the next iteration, hence a dangling pointer.
```c
struct node *next_node;

while (p != NULL) {
    next_node = p->next;
    free(p);
    p = next_node;
}

```
