## EXERCISE 17.11
Write the following function:
```c
int count_occurences(struct node *list, int n);
```
The `list` parameter points to a linked list: the function should return the number of times that `n` appears in this list.  Assume the `node` structure is the one defined in Section 17.5

### Solution
```c
struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
};

int count_occurences(struct node *list, int n)
{
    struct node *p;
    int count = 0;
    for (p = list; p != NULL; p = p->next) {
        if (p->value == n) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
