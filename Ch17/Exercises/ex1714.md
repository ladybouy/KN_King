## EXERCISE 17.14
Modify the `delete_from_list` function (Section 17.5) so that its first parameter has type `struct node**` (a pointer to the first node in a list) and its return type is void. `delete_from_list` must modify its first argument to point to the list after the desired node has been deleted.

### Solution
```c
struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
};

void *delete_from_list(strut node **list, int n)
{
    struct node *cur;
    struct node *prev;

    for (cur = *list; prev = NULL;
         cur != NULL && cur->value != n;
         prev = cur, cur = cur->next) { 
        ;
    }
    if (curr == NULL) {
        ;
    }
    if (prev == NULL) {
        *list = cur->next;
    } else {
        prev->next = cur->next;
    }
    free(cur);
}
```
