## EXERCISE 17.8
Section 15.2 describes a file, `stack.c`, that provides functions for storing integers in a stack. In that section, the stack was implemented as an array. Modify `stack.c` so that a stack is now stored as a linked list. Replace the `contents` and `top` variables by a single variable that points to the first node in the list (the "top" of the stack). Write functions in `stack.c` so that they use this pointer. Remove the `is_full` function, instead having `push` return either true (if memory was available to create a node) or `false` (if not).

### Solution
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
};

struct node *top = NULL;

bool push(int i)
{
    struct node *new_node;
    new_node = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    if (new_node == NULL) {
        printf("Unable to allocate memory with malloc, stack is full");
        return false;
    } else {
        new_node->value = i;
        new_node->next = top;
        top = new_node
        return true;
    }
}

void make_empty(void)
{
    struct node *temp;
    while (top != NULL) {
        temp = top; 
        top = top->next
        delete(temp);
    }
}

int pop(int i)
{
    struct node *temp;

    if (!push(i) {
        printf("Error: stack underflow!");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else {
        i = top->value;
        temp = top;
        top = top->next
        free(temp);
        return i;
    }
}
```
