## EXERCISE 18.6
The following function is supposed to print an error message. Each message is preceded by an integer, indicating the number of times the function has been called.  Unfortunately, the function always displays `1` as the number of the error message. Locate the error and show hot to fix it without making any changes outside functions.

```c
void print_error(cont char *message)
{
    int n = 1;
    print("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}
```

### Solution
```c
void print_error(cont char *message)
{
    static int n = 1;
    print("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}
```
