## EXERCISE 18.5
State whether each of the following statements is true or false. Justify each answer
- (a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope
- (b) Every variable declared inside a function has no linkage
- (c\) Every variable with internal linkage has static store duration
- (d) Every parameter has block scope

### Solution
- (a) false, a static variable declared in a block, only has block scope
- (b) true, variables defined in another file has no linkage 
- (c\) true, for a file to have only internal linkage, it has to be declared static outside a block
- (d) true, the parameter is not accessed outside the function
