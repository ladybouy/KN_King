## EXERCISE 18.12
(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function `f`, assuming that it's declared as follows:
```c
int (*f(float (*)(long), char*))(double);
```
(b) Give an example showing how f would be called.

### Solution
(a)
`f` is a function that accepts 2 parameters: a function pointer that accepts a `long` and returns a float and pointer to a `char`, that returns a function pointer that accepts a `double` that returns an `int`
(b)
```c
float test_function_pointer(long);
f(test_function_pointer, &ch)(2.);
```
