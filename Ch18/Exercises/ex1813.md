Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that `PI` is a macros that represents 3.14159.)
- (a) `char c = 65;`
- (b) `static int i = 5, j = i * i;`
- (c\) `double d = 2 * PI`;
- (d) `double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2};`

### Solution
- (a) legal
- (b) illegal
- (c\) legal
- (d) legal
