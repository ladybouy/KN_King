## EXERCISE 15.3
We saw what writing `#include \<file>` instead of `#include "file"` may not work if `file` is one that we've written.  Would there be any problem with writing `#include "file"` instead of `#include \<file>` if `file` is a system header?

### Solution
No, the compiler will first search the current directory, then search the directory (or directories) in which system header files reside.
