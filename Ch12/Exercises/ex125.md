### Exercise 12.5

Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable.  Assuming that the assignment p = a has been performed, which of the following expressions are illegal because of mismatch types?  Of the remaining expressions, which are true (have a nonzero value)?
```
(a) p == a[0]
(b) p == &a[0]
(c) *p == a[0]
(d) p[0] == a[0]
```

Solution:
```
(a) false
(b) true
(c) true
(d) true
```
