### EXERCISE 12.6

Rewrite the following function to use pointer arithmetic instead of array subscripting. (In other words, eliminate the variable i and all uses of the [] operator.) Make as few changes as possible.

```
int sum_array(const int a[], int n)
{
    int i, sum;

    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sum += a[i];
    return sum;
}
```

Solution:
```
int sum_array(const int a[], int n)
{
    int sum = 0;
    int *p;

    for (p = a; p < a + n; p++)
        sum += *p;
    return sum;
}
```
