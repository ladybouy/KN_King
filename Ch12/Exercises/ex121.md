### EXERCISE 12.1

Suppose that the following declaration are in effect:
```
int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
int *p = &a[1], *q = &a[5];
```
(a) What is the value of *(p+3)?
(b) What is the value of *(q-3)?
(c) What is the value of q-p?
(d) Is the condition p < q true or false?
(e) Is the condition *p < *q true of false?

Solution:
```
(a) *(p+3) = 14
(b) *(q-3) = 34 
(c) 4
(d) true 
(e) false
```
