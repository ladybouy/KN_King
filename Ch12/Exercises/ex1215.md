### Exercise 12.15

Write a loop that prints all temperature readings stored in row `i` of temperatures array (see Exercise 14).  Use a pointer to visit each element of the row.

Solution:
```
    int temperature[7][24];
    int *p;

    for (p = temperature[i]; p < temperature[i] + 24; p++) {
        printf("%d, ", *p);
    }

```
