### Exercise 12.2
Suppose that high, low, and middle are all pointer variables of the same type, and that low and high point to elements of an array.  Why is the following state illegal, and how could it fixed? 
```
middle = (low + high) / 2;
```

Solution:

C supports three (and only three) forms of pointer arithmetic:

    - Adding an integer to a pointer
    - Subtracting an integer from a pointer
    - Subtracting one pointer from another
```
middle = (high - low) / 2 + low;
```
