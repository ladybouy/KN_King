### Exercise 12.13

Section 8.2 had a program fragment in which two nested `for` loops initialized the array `ident` for use as an identity matrix. Rewrite the code, using a single pointer to step through the array one element at a time. *Hint*: since won't be using row and col index variables, it won't be easy to tell where to store 1. Instead, we can use the fact that the first element of the array be `1`. the next `N` elements should be `0`, the next element be `1` and so forth. Use a variable to keep track of how many consecutive 0s have been stored, when the count reaches `N`, it's time to store `1`.

Solution:
```
double ident[N][N];

int *p;
int zero_count = 0;

ident[1][1] = 1
for (p = ident[1][1]; p <= &ident[N-1][N-1]; p++) { 
    if (count = N) {
        *p = 1;
        zero_count = 0;
    } else {
        *p = 0;
        zero_count++;
    }
}
```
