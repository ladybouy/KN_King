### EXERCISE 9.7

Suppose that the function f has the following definition:
```
int f(int a, int b) {...}
```
Which of the following statements are legal? (Assume that i has type int and x has type double.)
```
(a) i = f(83, 12);
(b) x = f(83, 12);
(c) i = f(3.15, 9.28);
(d) x = f(3.15, 9.28);
(e) f(83, 12);
```
Solution:
```
(a) legal 
(b) legal
(c) legal
(d) legal
(e) legal
