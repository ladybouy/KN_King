<p>The following function, which computes the area of a triangle, contains two errors. Locate the errors and show how to fix them. (Hint: there are no errors in the formula.)</p>
<pre><code>double triangle_area(double base, height)
double product;
{
    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}</code></pre>
<p>Solution:</p>
<pre><code>double triangle_area(double base, double height)
{
    double product;
    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}</code></pre>
