## EXERCISE 16.2
(a) Declare structure variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, each having members real and imaginary of type double. \
(b) Modify the declaration in part (a) so that `c1`'s members initially have the values `0.0` and `1.0`, which `c2` members are `1.0` and `0.0` initially. (`c3` is not initialized.) \
(c) Write statements that copy the members of `c2` into `c1`. Can this be done in one statement, or does it require two? \
(d) Write statements that add the corresponding members of `c1` and `c2`, storing the result in `c3`.

### Solution
(a) 
```c
struct {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
} c1, c2, c3;
```
(b)
```c
struct {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
} c1 = {0.0, 1.0},
  c2 = {1.0, 0.0},
  c3;
```
(c)
This can be done in single statement as long as the members are compatible types, and in this, c1 and c2 are declared at the same time.
```c
c1 = c2;
```

(d)
```c
c3.real = c1.real + c2.real;
c3.imaginary = c1.imaginary + c2.imaginary;
```
