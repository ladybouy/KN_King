## EXERCISE 16.9
Write the following functions. (The `color` structure is defined in Exercise 8.) \
(a) `struct color make_color(int red, int green, int blue);`
Returns a `color` structure containing the specified red, green, blue values. If any arguments is less than zero, the corresponding member of the structure will contain zero instead. If any argument is greater than 255, the corresponding member of the structure will contain 255. \
(b) `int getRed(struct color c);` \
Returns the value of `c`'s `red` member.
(c) `bool equal_color(struct color color1, struct color color2);`\
Returns `true` if the corresponding members of `color` and `color1` are equal. \
(d) `struct color brighter(struct color c);` \
Returns a `color` structure that represents a brighter version of the color `c`. The structure is identical to `c`, except that each member has been divided by 0.7 (with the result truncated to an integer). However, there are three special cases: (1) If all members of `c` are zero, the function returns a color whose members have the value 3. (2) If any member of `c` is greater than 0, but less than 3, it is replaced by 3 before the division by 0.7. (3) If dividing by 0.7 causes a member to exceed 255, it is reduced to 255.
(e) `struct color darker(struct color c);` \
Returns a `color` structure that represents a darker version of the color c. The structure is identical to c, except that each member has been multiplied by 0.7 (with the result truncated to an integer).
## Solution
```c
struct color {
    int red;
    int green;
    int blue;
};
```
(a)
```c
struct color make_color (int red, int green, int blue)
{ 
    struct rColor;

    if (red < 0) {
        rColor.red = 0
    } else if (red > 255) {
        rColor.red = 255;

    if (green < 0) {
        rColor.green = 0
    } else if (green > 255) {
        rColor.green = 255;

    if (blue < 0) {
        rColor.blue = 0
    } else if (blue > 255) {
        rColor.blue = 255;

    return rColor = {red, green, blue}
}
```
(b)
```c
int getRed(struct color c)
{
    return color.red;
}
```
(c)
```c
bool equal_color(struct color color1, struct color color2)
{
    if ((color1.red   == color2.red) &&
        (color1.green == color2.green) &&
        (color1.blue  == color2.blue)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```
(d)
```c
struct color brighter(struct color c)
{
    if (c.red > 0 && c.red < 3) {
        c.red = 3;
    }
    if (c.green > 0 && c.green < 3) {
        c.green = 3;
    }
    if (c.blue > 0 && c.blue < 3) {
        c.blue = 3;
    }

    c.red = c.red / 0.7;
    c.green = c.green / 0.7;
    c.blue = c.blue / 0.7;

    if (c.red == 0) {
        c.red = 3;
    } else if (c.red > 255) {
        c.red = 255;
    }

    if (c.green == 0) {
        c.green = 3;
    } else if (c.green > 255) {
        c.green = 255;
    }

    if (c.blue == 0) {
        c.blue = 3;
    } else if (c.blue > 255) {
        c.blue = 255;
    }
}
```
(e)
```c
struct color darker(struct color c)
{
    if (c.red > 0 && c.red < 3) {
        c.red = 3;
    }
    if (c.green > 0 && c.green < 3) {
        c.green = 3;
    }
    if (c.blue > 0 && c.blue < 3) {
        c.blue = 3;
    }

    c.red = c.red * 0.7;
    c.green = c.green * 0.7;
    c.blue = c.blue * 0.7;

    if (c.red == 0) {
        c.red = 3;
    } else if (c.red > 255) {
        c.red = 255;
    }

    if (c.green == 0) {
        c.green = 3;
    } else if (c.green > 255) {
        c.green = 255;
    }

    if (c.blue == 0) {
        c.blue = 3;
    } else if (c.blue > 255) {
        c.blue = 255;
    }
}
```
