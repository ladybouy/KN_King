## EXERCISE 16.18
(a) Each square of a chessboard can hold one piece- a pawn, knight, bishop, rook queen or king - or it may be empty. Each piece is either black or white. Define two enumerated types: `Piece`, which has seven possible values (one of which is "empty"), and `Color` which has two. \
(b) Using the types from part(a), define a structure typed named `Square` that can store both the type of a piece and its color. \
(c) Using the `Square` type from part (b), declare an 8 x 8 array named `board` that can store the entire contents of a chessboard. \
(d) Add an initializer to the declaration in part (c) so that `boards` initial value corresponds to the usual arrangement of pieces at the start of a chess game. A square that's not occupied by a piece should have an "empty" piece value and the color black. \

### Solution
(a)
```c
typedef { EMPTY, PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING } Piece;
typedef { WHITE, BLACK } Color;
```
(b)
```c
typedef struct {
    Piece role;
    Color side;
} Square;
```
(c)
```c
Square board[8][8];
```
(d)
```c
Square board[8][8] = { { {ROOK, WHITE},  {KNIGHT, WHITE}, {BISOP, WHITE}, {KING, WHITE},
                         {QUEEN, WHITE}, {BISOP, WHITE}, {KNIGHT, WHITE}, {ROOK, WHITE} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK},
                         {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK}, {EMPTY, BLACK},  {EMPTY, BLACK} },
                       { {ROOK, BLACK},  {KNIGHT, BLACK}, {BISOP, BLACK}, {QUEEN, BLACK},
                         {KING, BLACK},  {BISOP, BLACK}, {KNIGHT, BLACK}, {ROOK, BLACK} } };
```
