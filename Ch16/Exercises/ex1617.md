Suppose that `b` and `i` are declared as follows:

enum {FALSE, TRUE} b;
int i;
```
Which of the following statements are legal? Which ones are "safe" (always yield a meaningful result)? \
(a) `b = FALSE;` \
(b) `b = i;` \
(c) `b++;` \
(d) `i = b;` \
(e) `i = 2 * b + 1;` \

### Solution
(a) Legal, safe \
(b) Legal, not safe \
(c) Legal, not safe \
(d) Legal, safe \
(e) Legal, safe \
