## EXERCISE 16.13
Suppose that `s` is the following structure (`point` is a structure tag declared in Exercise 10):
```c
struct shape {
    int shape_kind;         /* RECTANGLE or CIRCLE */ 
    struct point center;    /* coordinates of center */
    union {
        struct {
            int height, width;
        } rectangle;
        struct {
            int radius;
        } circle;
    } u;
}s;
```
If the value of `shape_kind` is `RECTANGLE` the `height` and `width` members store the dimensions of rectangle.  If the value of `share_kind` is `CIRCLE`, the radius member stores the radius of a circle.  Indicate which of the following statements are legal, and show how to repair the ones that aren't: \
(a) `s.share_kind = RECTANGLE;` \ 
(b) `s.center.x = 10;` \
(c) `s.height = 25;` \
(d) `s.u.rectangle.width = 8;` \
(e) `s.u.circle = 5;` \
(f) `s.u.radius = 5;`

### Solution
(a) Legal
(b) Legal
(c) Illegal
```c
s.u.rectangle.height = 25;
```
(d) Legal
(e) Illegal
```c
s.u.circle.radius = 5;
```
(f) Illegal
```c
s.u.circle.radius = 5;
```
