## EXERCISE 16.1

In the following declarations, the x and y structures have members named x and y:
```c
struct { int x, y; } x;
struct { int x, y; } y;
```
Are these declarations legal on an individual basis? Could both declarations appear as shown in a program? Justify your answer.

### Solution
Both declarations are legal. Both can appear in a program because the members are locally scoped with the struct declaration.
