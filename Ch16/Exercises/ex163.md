## EXERCISE 16.3
(a) Show how to declare a tag named `complex` for a structure with two members `real` and `imaginary`, of type `double`. \
(b) Use the `complex` tag to declare variables named `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`.
(c) Write a function named `make_complex` that stores its two arguments (both of type `double`) in a `complex` structure, then returns the structure. \
(d) Write function named `add_complex` that adds the corresponding members of its arguments (both complex structures), then returns the result (another complex structure). \

### Solution
(a)
```c
struct complex {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
};
```
(b)
```c
struct complex c1, c2 ,c3;
```
(c)
```c
struct complex make_complex(double aReal, double aImaginary)
{
    struct complex {
        double real;
        double imagnary;
    } complexStruct = {aReal, aImaginary};

    return complexStruct;
}
```
(d)
```c
struct complex add_complex(struct complex aComplex1, struct complex aComplex2)
{
    struct complex {
        double real;
        double imagnary;
    } complexStruct = {aComplex1.real + aComplex2.real,
                       aComplex1.imaginary + aComplex2.imaginary};

    return complexStruct;
}
