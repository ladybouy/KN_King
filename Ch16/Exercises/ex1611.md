## EXERCISE 16.11
Suppose that `s` is the following structure:
```c
struct {
    double a;
    union {
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    } e;
    char f[4];
} s;
```
If `char` values occur one byte, `int` values occupy four bytes, and `double` values occupy eight bytes, how much space will a C compilers allocate for `s`? (Assume that the compiler leaves no "holes" between members.)
k
### Solution
20 bytes
