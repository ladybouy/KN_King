## EXERCISE 16.12
Suppose that `u` is the following union:
```c
union {
    double a;
    struct {
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    } e;
    char f[4];
} u;
```
If `char` values occur one byte, `int` values occupy four bytes, and `double` values occupy eight bytes, how much space will a C compilers allocate for `u`? (Assume that the compiler leaves no "holes" between members.)
k

### Solution
16 bytes
