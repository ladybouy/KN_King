## EXERCISE 14.5
Let `TOUPPER(c) ('a' <= (c) && (c) <= 'z' ? (c) - 'a'+'A' : (c))`
Let `s` be a string and let `i` be an int variable. Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments.
```
(a) strcpy(s, "abcd");
    i = 0;
    putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));
(b) strcpy(s, "0123");
    i = 0;
    putchar(TOUPPER(s[++i]));
```

### Solution
```
(a) D
(b) 3  
```
