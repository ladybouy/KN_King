## EXERCISE 14.6
(a) Write a macro `DISP(f,x)` that expands into a call of `printf` that displays the value of the function when called with argument `x`. For example.
```
DISP(sqrt, 3.0);
```
should expand into
```
printf("sqrt(%g) = %g\n", 3.0, sqrt(3.0));
```
(b) Write a macro `DISP2(f, x, y)` that's similar to `DISP` but works for functions with two arguments.

### Solution
```
(a) #define DISP(f,x) printf("(f)(%g) = %g\n", (x), (f)((x)));
(b) #define DISP(f,x,y) printf("(f)(%g, %g) = %g\n", (x), (y), (f)((x),(y)));
```
