## EXERCISE 14.7
Let `GENERIC_MAX(type)` be the following macro:
```
#define GENERIC_MAX(type)       \
type type##_max(type x, type y)  \
{                               \
    return x > y ? x : y;       \
}
```
(a) Show the preprocessor's expansion of `GENERIC_MAX(long)`. \
(b) Explain why `GENERIC_MAX` doesn't work for basic types such as `unsigned long`. \
(c\) Describe a technique that would allow us to use `GENERIC_MAX` with basic type such as `unsigned long`. *Hint* Don't change the definition of `GENERIC_MAX`

### Solution
(a)
```
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
    return x > y ? x : y
}
```
(b)
Macro arguments become string literals, therefore the function will have space:
```
unsigned long unsigned long_max(unsigned long x, unsigned long y)
```
Which is an illegal function.

(c\)
 Define the type as a `typedef`:
 ```
 typedef unsigned long u_long;
 ```
