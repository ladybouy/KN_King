## EXERCISE 14.8
Suppose we want a macro that expands into a string containing the current line number and file name. In other words, we'd like to write
```
const char *str = LINE_FILE;
```
and have it expand into
```
const char *str = "line 10 of file foo.c";
```
where `foo.c` is the file containing the program and `10` is the line on which the invocation of `LINE_FILE` appears. *Warning*: This exercise is for experts only.  Be sure to read the Q&A section carefully before attempting!

### Solution
```
#define STRINGIT(n) #n
#define MACRO(n) STRINGIT(n)
#define LINE_FILE ("Line " MACRO(__LINE__) " of file " __FILE__)
```
