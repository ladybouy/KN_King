## EXERCISE 14.1

Write the parameterize macros that compute the following values.
```
(a) The cube of x.
(b) The remainder when n is divided by 4.
(c) 1 if the product of x and y is less than 100. 0 otherwise.
```
Do your macros always work? If not, describe what arguments would make them fail.

### Solution
```
(a) #define CUBE(x) (x)*(x)*(x), Always works
(b) #define REMAINDER(n) ((n)%4)
(c) #define PRODUCT(x, y) ((x)*(y)) < 100.0 ? 1 : 0
```
