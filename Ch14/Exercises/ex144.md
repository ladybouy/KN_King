## EXERCISE 14.4
For each of the following macros, give an example that illustrates a problem with the macro and show how to fix it.
```
(a) #define AVG(x,y) (x-y)/2
(b) #define AREA(x y) (x)*(y)
```

### Solution
```
(a)
    Example: 
        AVG(1+2,1+1) (1+2-1-1)/2
    Fix: 
        #define AVG(x,y) (((x)-(y))/2)
(b)
    Example:
        1/AREA(2,3) 1/2*3
    Fix:
        #define AREA(x,y) ((x)*(y))
```
