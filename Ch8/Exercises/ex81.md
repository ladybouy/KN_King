## EXERCISE 8.1
We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof (a[0]) to calculate the number of elements in an array. The expression size(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type of a's elements, would also work, but it's considered an inferior technique. Why?

### Answer 
The is an inferior technique because it's dependent on the type.  The former allows one to change the type in one place.
