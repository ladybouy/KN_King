## EXERCISE 13.2

Suppose that p has been declared as follows:
```
char *p = "abc";
```
Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by each legal call, and explain why others are illegal.

```
(a) putchar(p);
(b) putchar(*p);
(c) puts(p);
(d) puts(*p);
```

### Solution
```
(a) illegal, putchar expects a character, but got a pointer to a char
(b) legal, a.  *p is the value of a.  p points to the first element of the array
(c) legal, abc 
(d) illegal, received the value 'a' when it was expecting a pointer
```
