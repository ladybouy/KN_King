## EXERCISE 13.10
The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string.  What's wrong with the function?
```
char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
    char *q;
    strcp(q, p);
    return q;
}
```

### Solution
`q` doesn't point to anywhere, therefore copying p into q is undefined. \
`q` is not accessible outside the function since is it declared inside the function.
