## EXERCISE 13.3

Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:
```
scanf("%d%s%d", &i, s, &i);
```
If the user enters `12abc34` `56d78`, what will be the values of `i`, `s` and `j` after the call? (Assume that `i` and `j`are int variables and s is an array of characters.)

### Solution
```
i = 12
j = abc34, reads a string until it reaches the first white space
i = 56 
```
