##Exercise 13.18

Write the following function:
```
void remove_filename(char *url);
```
`url` points to a string containing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that ends with a file name (such as "http://www.knking.com/index.html"). The function should modify the string by removing the file name and the preceding slash. (In this example, the result will be "http://www.knking.com") Incorporate the "search for the end of a string" idiom into your function. *Hint:* Have the function replace the last slash in the string by a null character.

###Solution
```
void remove_filename(char *url)
{
    char *ptr = url;
    while (*ptr) {
        ptr++;
    };

    while (*--ptr) {
        if (*ptr == '/') {
            *ptr == '\0';
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
