## EXERCISE 13.6

Write a function named `censor` that modifies a string by replacing every occurrence of `foo` by `xxx`. For example, the string "food fool" would become"xxxd xxxl". Make the function as short as possible without sacrificing clarity.

### Solution
```
void censor(char *aString)
{
    char ptr;
    for (ptr = aString; *ptr != '\0'; ptr++)
    {
        if (*ptr == 'f' && *(ptr + 1) == 'o' && *(ptr + 2) == 'o')
        {
            *ptr = 'x';
            *(ptr+1) = 'x';
            *(ptr+2) = 'x';
        }
    }
}
```
