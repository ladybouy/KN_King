## EXERCISE 13.9
What will the value of the string `str` after the following statements have been executed?
```
strcpy(s1, "computer");
strcpy(s2, "science");
if(strcmp(s1, s2)) < 0)
    strcat(s1, s2);
else
    strcat(s2, s1);
s1[strlen(s1)-6] = '\0';
```
### Solution
```
s1  is "computer science" after strcat(s1, s2);
s1 is "computer\0" after s1[strlen(s1)-6] = '\0';
```
