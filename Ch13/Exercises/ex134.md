# Exercise 13.4

Modify the `read_line` function in each of the following ways:
(a) Have it skip white space before beginning to store input characters.
(b) Have it stop reading at the first white-space character. *Hint:* To determine whether or not a character is white, call the `isspace` function.
(c) Have it stop reading at the first new-line character, then store the new-line character in the string.
(d) Have it leave behind characters that it doesn't have room to store.

### Solution
```
int read_line(char str[], int n)
{
    int ch, i = 0;

    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n' && ch != EOF)
        if (isspace(str[0]))
            continue;
        else if (isspace(str[i]))
            break;
        else if (ch == '\n')
            str[i++] = ch; 
            break;
        else if (i < n)
            str[i++] = ch;
    str[i] = '\0';
    return i;
}
```
