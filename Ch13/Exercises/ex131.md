## EXERCISE 13.1

The following function calls supposedly writes a single new-line character, but some are incorrect. Identify which calls don't work and explain why.


```
(a) printf("%c", '\n');
(b) printf("%c", "\n");
(c) printf("%s", '\n');
(d) printf("%s", "\n");
(e) printf('\n');
(f) printf("\n");
(g) putchar('\n');
(h) putchar("\n");
(i) puts('\n');
(j) puts("\n");
(k) puts(" ");
```

### Solution:
```
(a) legal
(b) illegal, expecting a character, but got a pointer instead
(c) illegal, expecting a string, but a character instead
(d) legal 
(e) illegal, printf expects a pointer as its first argument 
(f) legal
(g) legal
(h) illegal, expecting a character, but a string literal instead
(i) illegal, expecting a string, but got a character instead
(j) legal, but unnecessary because puts always writes an additional new-line character
(k) legal
```
