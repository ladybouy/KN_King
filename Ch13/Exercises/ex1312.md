## EXERCISE 13.12

Write the following function:
```
void get_extension(const char *file_name, char *extension);
```
`file_name` points to a string containing a file. The function should store the extension on the file in the string pointed to by extension. For example, if the file name is "memo.txt", the function will store "txt" in the string pointed to by `extension`.  If the file name doesn't have an extension, the function should store an empty string (a single null character) in the string pointed to by `extension`. Keep the function as simple as possible by having it use the `strlen` and `strcpy` functions.

### Solution
```
void get_extension(const char *file_name, char *extension)
{
    bool ext_exists = false;
    const char *p;

    for (p = file_name; *p != '\0'; p++)
    {
        if (*p == '.') {
            ext_exists = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (ext_exists) {
        strcpy(extension, (p+1));
    } else {
        strcpy(extension, "");
    }
}
```
